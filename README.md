# City Skyline

## Project Overview
The **City Skyline** project is a CSS-based visual representation of an urban skyline. The project is designed to demonstrate advanced CSS techniques, including the use of CSS variables, gradients, flexbox, and media queries. The skyline transitions from a day scene to a night scene as the browser window is resized, showcasing responsive design practices.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The skyline adjusts based on the browser's width, providing a seamless experience across different screen sizes. When the window width is reduced to 1000px or less, the scene transitions from day to night.
- **CSS Variables:** The use of CSS variables (`--building-color` and `--window-color`) makes it easy to change the color scheme of the buildings and windows. This also simplifies the transition from day to night.
- **Gradients:** The skyline background features a radial gradient that mimics the sun during the day and the moon at night. Buildings use linear gradients to create various window designs.
- **Flexbox Layout:** Buildings and windows are positioned using flexbox, allowing for easy alignment and spacing of elements.
- **Media Queries:** Media queries are used to switch the color scheme and background of the skyline, providing an interactive experience that changes from day to night based on the window size.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** The structure of the project is built using  HTML5 elements.
- **CSS3:** The visual styling is entirely handled by CSS3, with a focus on modern techniques like variables, gradients, and flexbox.
